# Recipe App

A simple web app that allows users to search for recipes and view detailed nutritional information (calories) using the Spoonacular API.

## Description

This project is a Recipe App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can search for recipes based on ingredients and get a list of matching recipes. The app fetches data from the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to provide recipe information, including images, recipe links, and nutritional details (like calories).
